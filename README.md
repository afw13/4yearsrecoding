# 4 Year ReCoding: An Alzheimer's Journey In Data

### Introduction
In 2020, our mom was enrolled in the ReCODE Protocol™, a program targeting cognitive decline reversal. Despite its ineffectiveness for her, we wanted to share our comprehensive daily dataset of supplements, meals, medications, and biomarkers in the hopes that it will benefit others embarking on a similar journey.

The first iteration of the ‘ReCoding’ project is also my final project for CS50.  For this project, I wanted to develop a website that would eventually provide a large data table for browsing and analysis.  For the first iteration of this project, the website links to a 14-day sample of the data, located in the project data sheet.  The website also includes some supporting resources related to the program.  All of these components will continue to evolve even after CS50 Fall 2023 ends.

### Components:
This project has 4 main components:

1. **A single-page website**: https://afw13.github.io/4yearsrecoding/

2. **A website wireframe** designed in Figma.  I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn Figma.  Having a wireframe designed in advance, helped to pace my coding and keep it focused on distinct elements. 

3. **A datasheet**.  Presently, this sheet contains a 14-day set of data, linked on the website.  Once the datasheet is more fully populated, it will be embedded on the website.

4. **A codebase**.  The website relies on HTML, CSS and Javascript, all available in Github.  

### Known Issues:

>> The website currently exists as a single page.  In future iterations, I’d like to build out separate pages for the About, Research and Resources sections and add page content to each. 

>> The Learn More button does not click out to anything
